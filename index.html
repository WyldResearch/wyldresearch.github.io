<p>Wyld Research was formed to explore new mesh topologies and their associated business domains and opportunities. We're working on new ways for mobile devices to interact directly and personally, and we're designing the experience to be safe, simple, intuitive and personally unique.</p>
<!-- 
building solutions for ad hoc mobile mesh networks, wireless sensor networks, and wireless mesh networks. It's our intention to exploit every sensor possible on the phone to generate targeted data that will improve the quailty and integity of information to yield highly personalised results. -->

<a id="designer-templates" class="anchor" href="#designer-templates" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Personal Area Mesh Experience</h3>

<p>When standing next to a person with whom you would like to send a large photo or video, it makes little sense to send it Over-The-Top (OTT): Up to the Internet, maybe travelling thousands of miles, and back down to the person next to you. But we do it all of the time, without thinking.</p>
<p>If we begin to think about the Bluetooth and P2P WiFi on our phones as direct communications channels, we can begin to imagine a way that is less costly and more secure than sending by and exposing it on the internet. And we can imagine that very personal experience not only providing new interaction opportunities, but also needing controls and checks.</p>

<a id="creating-pages-manually" class="anchor" href="#creating-pages-manually" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Research + Development</h3>

<p>The technolgies that support mesh networking, mainly Bluetooth and P2P WiFi, are evolving quickly. The Internet Of Things is driving a lot of effort in the Wireless Mesh Networking and Wireless Sensor Network camps. 
But even Ad Hoc Mesh Networking, once mainly the subject of Military and Academic research, is gaining commercial adoption.</p>
